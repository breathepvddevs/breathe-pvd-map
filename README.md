<h1>Breathe Providence Data Map</h1>

This repository hosts the code for the interactive map displayed in the website for Breathe Providence, an air pollution monotoring network. The app is currently hosted on Heroku and was built using a combination of Node.js, Javascript and Python. The most recent deployment can be found here: https://breath-pvd-map.herokuapp.com/


The values for CO<sub>2</sub> are updated every hour and displayed on the map. Since May, the timeseries feature has been deployed. You can click on a particular node to view it's current CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and to display a timeseries of the concentration during the past 24 hours. During this period there will be several changes to the source. We apologize for the inconvinience.

Through the summer, we are working on making the timeseries display the concentrations for the past week, month and year as well as the past 24 hours. In addition, we are also working on adding other pollutants to the map. 

For any inqueries about the source code please reach out to livia_gimenes@brown.edu. Instructions on how to use replicate this map for your own research group will be available after the features developed in the summer are fully deployed.For inqueries about the project reach out to breatheprovidence@brown.edu.
