# breathe-pvd

This repository hosts the code for the interactive map displayed in the Breathe Providence, an air pollution monotoring network. The app is currently hosted on heroku and built using Node.js and Javascript. The calibrations are as off now run in Python. As off Feb 22, updates are being made to both speed up and add more features, an interactive time series and more components. Results may vary as well as accuracy for the following week. We apoligize for any inconvinience.
